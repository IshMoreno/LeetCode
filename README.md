# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by
data structure and algorithmic pattern.

## Languages
- Python (primary for interviews)
- C# (professional background)

## Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Practice clean, readable code
- Prepare for backend and cloud engineering interviews

## Structure
- Problems are grouped by pattern (arrays, hashmaps, sliding window, etc.)
- Each solution includes time and space complexity
- Some problems include multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)

## Progress
- Arrays & Hashing: In Progress
- Sliding Window: Planned
- Trees & Graphs: Planned
